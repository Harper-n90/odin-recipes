## Objectives
With this project I hope to demostrate a basic understanding of HTML. Particularly headings, links, images, lists

I also hope to demostrate competent use of Git and Github.

## New objectives
As I now have a basic understanding I hope to make this site look a lot better. Still not great mind you,
but better for sure.
